# bl-datascientist-takehome-assessment
Congratulations on making it to the Behaviour Lab take-home task! We know these can be long and tedious but this one is different - please spend no longer than 40-60 minutes on the task and try to have fun.

Please fork this repository, and complete each task within the repository.

Once you've finished, submit the project to `jobs@behaviourlab.com`, `yannis@behaviourlab.com`, and `thomas@behaviourlab.com`:

## What we are testing

Let’s cut to the chase - candidates hate it when the tests are confusing and its not clear what they’re for. We like to be transparent, so for full disclosure, this test aims to evaluate a candidates ability:

- to solve and break down problems
- to write performant yet readable Python code

## Advice

Don't overcomplicate it and build the best solution you can within the time constraints. Goodluck!
